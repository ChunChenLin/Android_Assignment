Sunshine
===

Sunshine is a fork of the companion Android app originally used for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Follow the branches to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!


### Note: OpenWeatherMap API Key Required

An API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.

We recommend that each student obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties:

MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY\>"
